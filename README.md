# BattleBot Tactics

## Work In Progress
I'm still actively working on this project and many of the below mentioned "features" aren't implemented at the moment or just don't yet work as intended. 
The following text shows how the bot is supposed to work when it's finished.

## How To Play

- use ```/play``` to start playing
- turn-based strategy game
- choose between different types of units
  - eg. Warrior, Wizard, Archer
- either attack, defend or use your character's **unique special power**

## Rewards
- use ```/inventory``` to see all the items you currently own
- gain XP after every match to upgrade and strengthen your characters
- use your shiny gold coins to unlock new characters

## The Shop
- use ```/shop``` to view all the available items
- lootboxes to collect new character badges
  - 10 badges to unlock a character
  - Mini Boxes -> 2 random badges
  - Giant Boxes -> 5 random badges
- buy badges of your choice
